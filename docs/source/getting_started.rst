Installation
============

The project is published on PyPi and can therefore be installed via pip.

.. code:: bash
    
    python3 -m pip install maskit

If you prefer to use the latest development version, you can also install the
framework directly from GitHub.

.. code:: bash

    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/cirkiters/maskit.git
